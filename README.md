# GeoCausality

This package is designed to house multiple methods that are used to analyze the effect of our treatment group 
through randomized geo-level A/B tests. 

This package will contain methods from:
* Geoexperiments
* MatchedMarkets
* CausalImpact
* GeoLift
* Difference-in-differences
* Fixed Effects
